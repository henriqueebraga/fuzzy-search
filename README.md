# React Project

This is a React project using Vite, Typescript, and Sass with BEM.

## Input Action
When you interact with the input field, it triggers an action that's followed by a friendly console log, displaying the details of the action.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- Typescript
- Sass with BEM

## Why Vite?

This project uses Vite as the build tool and development server. Vite is known for its speed and efficiency, 
making the development experience faster and more pleasant.

## Why Fuse js

This project utilizes Fuse.js for fuzzy searching, which offers a lightweight and efficient solution for text search operations. It's particularly well-suited for smaller projects where the need is to accurately find similar or partially matching data.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install project dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

4. Run the command 'npm run dev' to start the project in the port:3000

## What can be extended

1. Cache Strategy
I highly recommend implementing a cache strategy to give this application a significant performance boost.

2. Unit Tests
It's a great idea to secure this project's stability and reliability by creating unit tests for our components and functionality. I suggest using popular testing tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

3. Lint
It's great setting up a linting tool, such as ESLint, to maintain consistent code style. This ensures that the codebase remains clean and readable, while also catching any potential issues early in the development process.

4. Prettier
We can significantly improve our codebase by integrating Prettier. This tool automatically formats our code, making it consistent and easy to read. It's a great way to enforce clean coding practices across the project.

5. Husky
To maintain high code quality standards, I recommend utilizing Husky. By setting up pre-commit and pre-push hooks, we can ensure that all code changes meet linting and testing criteria before they are committed or pushed to our repository. This helps us avoid common errors and keeps our codebase in excellent shape.

5. Elastic Search
I strongly recommend Elasticsearch for larger projects that require advanced search capabilities, scalability, and robust support for complex data structures.
